# hayata-yamamoto

I'm hayata-yamamoto, personally creating tools for my usable languages ( TypeScript, Python, Terraform, and so on). My working location is Japan. Currently, I'm focusing on providing some TypeScript and Python tools to make developers experience/productivities more efficient and reduce their annoying.
